# Week 1

## Project Description
Artboard allows users to be able to browse and search for images or videos that are stored in the app's database, as well as communicate with other users. This platform is targeted towards an art community, and the purpose of it is to make it easier for people to find tutorials, videos, or reference images in one place. Users will be able to save videos or images into folders, and revisit them later, and will also be able to send images or videos to other users in the messages component of the app.

In the alternate design, I changed the typograhpy to one I don't prefer as much, and I experimented with and used significantly different colour choices from my first design. However, I have kept the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
