# Week 1

## Project Description
Artboard allows users to be able to browse and search for images or videos that are stored in the app's database, as well as communicate with other users. This platform is targeted towards an art community, and the purpose of it is to make it easier for people to find tutorials, videos, or reference images in one place. Users will be able to save videos or images into folders, and revisit them later, and will also be able to send images or videos to other users in the messages component of the app.

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to log in with username / email and password.
- Users are able to see images / videos they have saved in folders.
- Users are able to see their messages with other users.
- Users are able to watch videos and view images on the app.
- Users can set folders and their profile to be public or private.
- Users are able to add images or videos.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The app is aesthetically pleasing.
- The app should be easy to use for first time users.
- The app should be able to work smoothly.
- Buttons and links in the app work properly.
- Functions are carried out quickly (under 2 seconds).

## Week 2

## Best Practice
- The colour palette should be kept the same throughout the entire website for consistency.
- The fonts / typography should also be kept consistent, using only a few fonts to establish the hierarchy of the site.
- The icons should be consistent, and icons could be made bold if the user is on that page.
- Features like the navigation bar should be placed in the same spot on the screen.
- Spacing and margins should be comfortable to look at, so margins aren't too large or too small.
- The colour palette aims to make the site seem welcoming, and to further increase the sense of friendliness, all the buttons of the site would have rounded corners.
- The images should be high quailty. 

## Navigation
The navigation bar is kept at the bottom of the screen, and the main features of the site can be found there, like the search page, messages page, and profile page. The page for users to add elements to the site is also kept in the navigation bar for easy access.

## Hierarchy
To differentiate the hierarchy, the heading fonts would be Bodoni Moda, and other smaller texts would be in Montserrat.
- for example, in the profile page, the number of followers / following would be in Bodoni Moda, and the words 'followers' and 'following' would be in Montserrat.
- parts of the website that require input, like the search bar, and the log in page, the font would be Montserrat.

## Colour Palette
The colour palette should feel welcoming and friendly to the user, and there should be a colour contrast so that the user is able to read things clearly. This design uses neutral and warm colours.

## Week 3
### Alternate Website Design

### UI Features
| Features | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Colour Palette | #FFF5E8, #DDE4D8, #416156, #BB8588, #9E7174 |
| Typography | Comfortaa, Rubik |
| Hierarchy | Comfortaa for titles, Rubik for other text, bold for emphasis |
| Navigation | Navigation bar with most of the features located at the bottom of screen |

In the alternate design, I changed the typograhpy to one I don't prefer as much, and I experimented with and used significantly different colour choices from my first design. However, I have kept the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Week 4
### Flowchart
The flowchart is of the steps taken by the user when they want to save an image, video, or tutorial.
