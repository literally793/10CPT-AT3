## Week 8

Continued to develop the UI aspects of the web page
Home page
<img width="1676" height="897" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 at 14 13 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e8c6019-fc88-4556-b58f-3f4de49f4677" />
The home page has a scroll function, and the images are interactable, but haven't been linked to a page that allows them to be downloaded or saved to the user profile yet.
Messages page
<img width="1674" height="894" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 at 14 13 21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b279208-05a9-45c2-94aa-d8290d9fbdaf" />
The messages block needs to be moved towards the left to be centered, which will be done later on when I refine the UI elements.
Profile page
<img width="1682" height="895" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-22 at 14 14 25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e1706d9-dca7-4a5e-862e-7e80d20e3756" />
