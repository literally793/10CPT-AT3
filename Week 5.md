<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **What data do you want to be stored during the use of your app?**
for login: username, email, first name and last name
2. **What data do you want displayed on your front end?**
show the user's username, email, first name and last name in their profile, and show the file name and tags in files that they have saved, also found in their profile
3. **What data is related to each other?**
the username is required for the files database, as to create customised feeds, it is important to collect the username and the tags on files that they have saved
4. **What data types should be used for elements in your database?**
the data types will mainly consist of image files, text files, and video files
5. **What queries might you need to write (between and across tables) allowing for good information storage and retrieval?**
whats a query

stuff to do: sql backend for the feed, how images are going to be picked for the user, eg tags


notes about your work (think about diary notes), a couple of points about where your are collecting your data from and a list of your SQL queries you are making.



a) Set-up your development environment of your web application. Follow through the document below - entitled SET-UP - and make sure all your Extensions in VSCode are installed and running.

b) Create your own database structure - consider table names, data headings, primary keys, foreign keys, types of data stored etc.

c) Create test data to enter into your backend - manually enter some test data to check the structure works and then work on collecting/creating more data to import in Excel or manually.

d) Write a series (5+) of SQL queries to combine and test your data is displaying correctly from your tables - read through SQL Tutorial
for some ideas - PS. SELECT * FROM "Table" is only a very, very basic Query - create several from across tables showing joins and MEANINGFUL data that a user might find useful.


Client: developer presents their database structure and queries to you. Discuss whether you see any problems coming from the table
setup, the test data or whether the queries are useful or not for front end display (does it make sense and would it work as intended?) Does the developer understand what is needed for back-end to be constructed properly or not? Are you confident they have designed and created a ROBUST backend for your web app?
