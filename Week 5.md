stuff to do: sql backend for the feed, how images are going to be picked for the user, eg tags

notes about your work (think about diary notes), a couple of points about where your are collecting your data from and a list of your SQL queries you are making.

In web development, we work with various technologies that allow us to create and style layers responsible for various parts of our solution - think along the lines of "Full Stack" development. For our task this week, we are looking at the fundamental layer - the data layer that everything else is going to be relying on.

what data do you want stored during the use of your app?
what date you want displayed on your front end?
what data is related to each other - needing keys set-up for each table
what data types should for elements be in your database (text, numeric, image etc)
what queries might you need to write (between and across tables) allowing for good information storage and retrieval

a) Set-up your development environment of your web application. Follow through the document below - entitled SET-UP - and make sure all your Extensions in VSCode are installed and running.

b) Create your own database structure - consider table names, data headings, primary keys, foreign keys, types of data stored etc.

c) Create test data to enter into your backend - manually enter some test data to check the structure works and then work on collecting/creating more data to import in Excel or manually.

d) Write a series (5+) of SQL queries to combine and test your data is displaying correctly from your tables - read through SQL Tutorial
for some ideas - PS. SELECT * FROM "Table" is only a very, very basic Query - create several from across tables showing joins and MEANINGFUL data that a user might find useful.

Client: developer presents their database structure and queries to you. Discuss whether you see any problems coming from the table
setup, the test data or whether the queries are useful or not for front end display (does it make sense and would it work as intended?) Does the developer understand what is needed for back-end to be constructed properly or not? Are you confident they have designed and created a ROBUST backend for your web app?
