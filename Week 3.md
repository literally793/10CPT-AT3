## Navigation
The navigation bar is still located at the bottom of the screen like the other design, because most phone apps have it at the bottom. However, the icons have changed to be more simple, and the add button has been made larger because it leads to more functions, like creating a folder, instead of just adding images / tutorials / images to the database.

## Hierarchy
To differentiate the hierarchy, the font for the heading is Comfortaa, and the font for other text is Rubik.

## Colour Palette
To maintain a sense of friendliness to the user, the main colours are a pastel green, which is a cool colour, but makes up for it by being soft and light. There is a darker green for contrast. The other set of colours used are a light pink for less important buttons, like the folders in the profile page, and the darker colour to contrast this is a darker shade of pink.
