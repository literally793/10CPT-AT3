## Best Practice

## Navigation
The navigation bar is still located at the bottom of the screen like the other design, because most phone apps have it at the bottom. However, the icons have changed to be more simple, and the add button has been made larger because it leads to more functions, like creating a folder, instead of just adding images / tutorials / images to the database.
