## Best Practice
- The colour palette should be kept the same throughout the entire website for consistency.
- The fonts / typography should also be kept consistent, using only a few fonts to establish the hierarchy of the site.
- The icons should be consistent, and icons should change from mainly white to mainly black when the user is on the page.
- Features like the navigation bar should be placed in the same spot on the screen.
- Spacing and margins should be comfortable to look at, so margins aren't too large or too small.
- The colour palette aims to make the site seem welcoming, and to further increase the sense of friendliness, all the buttons of the site would have rounded corners.
- The images should be high quailty.

## Navigation
The navigation bar is kept at the bottom of the screen, and the main features of the site can be found there, like the search page, messages page, and profile page. The page for users to add elements to the site is also kept in the navigation bar for easy access.

## Hierarchy
To differentiate the hierarchy, the heading fonts would be Bodoni Moda, and other smaller texts would be in Montserrat.
- for example, in the profile page, the number of followers / following would be in Bodoni Moda, and the words 'followers' and 'following' would be in Montserrat.
- parts of the website that require input, like the search bar, and the log in page, the font would be Montserrat.

## Colour Palette
The colour palette should feel welcoming and friendly to the user, and there should be a colour contrast so that the user is able to read things clearly.
